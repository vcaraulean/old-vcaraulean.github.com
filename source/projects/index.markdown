Check it out, a free trial version is available. Let me know if you like it and [what are you missing or want improved](http://gitstation.uservoice.com)!

## [NHibernate.Search](https://github.com/vcaraulean/NHibernate.Search)

My fork of NHibernate.Search project. NHibernate.Search.Fluent project contains a Fluent API to bridge entities to Lucene indexes. Allows to define which properties will be indexed by Lucene with some configuration options. Refactored some parts of original NHibernate.Search to ease manipulation with mapping definitions.

Project status: it works for basic scenarios. It works in my projects but it's still lacking some features and advanced options. Paused the development as I hope to ditch NHibernate altogether some day and use a [document database with embedded search feature](http://ravendb.net).

## [Caliburn.Micro.Telerik](https://github.com/vcaraulean/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik)

An integration between Telerik components and [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com). Includes a set of conventions and helper classes for Telerik controls targeted to Silverlight and WPF. Also includes a set of examples and applications to test and demo conventions. Code is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/vcaraulean/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik), a [NuGet package is available](http://nuget.org/packages/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik). You can use the package or simply copy the few source files to your project.

## [mGitHub.SampleApp](https://github.com/vcaraulean/mGitHub.SampleApp)

A sample Windows Phone 7 application, a client application for GitHub. It was written using Caliburn.Micro and uses the GitHub API to talk to the backend. It was my first app for Windows Phone, written in early days of WP7 platform. 

This application have won the [2010 Caliburn.Micro Application Contest](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=2010%20Caliburn.Micro%20Application%20Contest%20Winners) in Windows Phone category.

#### ...and there is more

...but they aren't public yet and may never be. Tryouts, proof of concepts and few new ideas for apps still waiting to get a timeslot of my spare time.
