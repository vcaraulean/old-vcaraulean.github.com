    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m watching a recording of Windows Phone Design Days, it’s the part about “perceived performance” with Jaime Rodriguez. He put up a nice table with response times and recommended visual feedback. I’ve seen these recommendations before. I’ve talked about these recommendations with my team. I’m insisting applying them every time when I see in out apps that an action has no visual response within one second after triggering it.</p>

<p>Even if it’s talking in context of User Experience on Windows Phone, I think these numbers are a formal guidance for good user experience on every device, modern gadget or software application.</p>

<p>I’ll make a copy of this table here, just to keep it in a handy place for further reference. It’s so well worth keeping it...</p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>system response time</th>
        <th>duration</th>
        <th>recommended feedback</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>instantaneous response</td>
        <td>bellow 100 milliseconds</td>
        <td>built in common controls</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>immediate response</td>
        <td>between 500 milliseconds and 1 second</td>
        <td>built in common controls</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>very short wait</td>
        <td>2 seconds or less</td>
        <td>built in common controls</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>short wait</td>
        <td>2 to 5 seconds</td>
        <td>progress bars</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>moderate wait</td>
        <td>5 to 10 seconds</td>
        <td>progress bar with details like percentage completition or time remaining</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>long wait</td>
        <td>10 seconds or greater</td>
        <td>progress bar with details of sub steps. Allow user to move to other tasks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>continuous feedback</td>
        <td>long process</td>
        <td>progress bar with details of sub steps. Allow user to move to other tasks</td>
    </tr>
</table>
