	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I’m watching a recording of Windows Phone Design Days, it’s the part about “perceived performance” with Jaime Rodriguez. He put up a nice table with response times and recommended visual feedback. I’ve seen these recommendations before. I’ve talked about these recommendations with my team. I’m insisting applying them every time when I see in out apps that an action has no visual response within one second after triggering it.</p>

<p>Even if it’s talking in context of User Experience on Windows Phone, I think these numbers are a formal guidance for good user experience on every device, modern gadget or software application.</p>

<p>I’ll make a copy of this table here, just to keep it in a handy place for further reference. It’s so well worth keeping it&#8230;</p>

<table border="1">

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>There are times when you want to handle a “MouseDoubleClick” event in your code and execute something in your ViewModel as a response to the event . Back in the day, I’ve done few implementations of mechanism that will allow do this, for both WPF and Silverlight platforms, with different degrees of success and (developer) satisfaction. The one I’ll be talking is, so far, the prettiest and I like how it works. Mostly because of using <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=All%20About%20Actions&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">Actions from Caliburn.Micro</a> framework. The Actions mechanics gives a very neat way to execute logic in VM’s as a response to UI events. A typical example for declaring an action will be:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button Content="Remove"
        cal:Message.Attach="[Event Click] = [Action Remove($dataContext)]" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Back to the Mouse Double Click or, better said, to lack of such event in Silverlight.</p>

<p>Most of implementations you’ll find in internet will play with catching sequential clicks or “MouseLeftButtonUp” events and then deciding, it was a double click or not (using TimeSpan and distance between clicks, <a href="http://www.michaelsnow.com/2010/05/10/silverlight-tip-of-the-day-17-double-click/">sample implementation</a>). The interesting bit however was to link this event to an Action to be executed by Caliburn.Micro on your ViewModel and reuse that for any visual elements.</p>

<p>First, I’ve set the API how I want to see it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding DisplayName}"
           Behaviors:DoubleClickEvent.AttachAction="Open($datacontext)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It will be a behavior that can be attached to any UI Element. In Action string we’re skipping specification of what event will be the Action attached to, because we are emulating one event – DoubleClick.</p>

<p>Attaching of the Action string to MouseLeftButtonUp is the tricky part. Mostly because to achieve that I had to modify declaration of one method in Caliburn.Micro for making it public. See <a href="https://hg01.codeplex.com/forks/vcaraulean/caliburnmicro/rev/ab06fc1697c7">this changeset</a> in my CM fork if you’re interested in details, but I’ll be asking CM’s authors to incorporate the change in main repository.</p>

<p>Attaching action string:</p>

<pre><code>private static void AttachActionToTarget(string text, DependencyObject d)
{
    var actionMessage = Parser.CreateMessage(d, text);

    var trigger = new ConditionalEventTrigger
    {
        EventName = "MouseLeftButtonUp",
        Condition = e =&gt; DoubleClickCatcher.IsDoubleClick(d, e)
    };
    trigger.Actions.Add(actionMessage);

    Interaction.GetTriggers(d).Add(trigger);
}
</code></pre>

<p>ConditionalEventTrigger is a small class that wraps EventTrigger and adding a condition that will be checked before raising event. If it’s false, event will not be raised. Snippet:</p>

<pre><code>public class ConditionalEventTrigger : EventTrigger
{
    public Func&lt;EventArgs, bool&gt; Condition { get; set; }

    protected override void OnEvent(EventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        if (Condition(eventArgs))
            base.OnEvent(eventArgs);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I’ll not show here DoubleClickCatcher class because it’s not small, but you can find all related classes in <a href="https://gist.github.com/704830">this gist</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>So far, I’m satisfied by this solution. Neat, simple and it works like a charm for us. I’ve used it with ListBox and DataGrid controls, but I think it should work on pretty any other visual element.</p>

		<p>&#8230; when in order to look at some debug data in runtime you’re not writing log messages, not inspecting with debugger your data, not dumping structures to files. Instead, you’re taking the most confortable route, which is write a Widget and show it in the Dashboard of your app. Oh my, that was really fun to discover.</p>

<p>How to cook it – Silverlight, Castle Winsor and Caliburn Micro. Add a good part of ‘conventions over configuration’. Mixing together you’re implementing the <strong>Concept</strong> – Dashboard and Widgets. After internal mechanics are done (and tested), adding new <strong>Features</strong> (concrete Widgets) are piece of cake.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In this post I would try to explore multi-targeting of a .NET project/solution using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921108(PandP.20">Project Linker</a>.aspx) tool. My main driver is desire to target one of our internal projects to Silverlight. I’ve picked <a href="http://github.com/castleproject/Castle.Core">Castle.Core</a> to serve as an example, since his Silverlight build is now broken and (from what I’ve seen) there is no convenient way to work with this project in Visual Studio while targeting Silverlight.</p>

<p>For more details and screenshots of Project Linker, please refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921108(PandP.20">this MSDN article</a>.aspx).</p>

<p>Let’s go, step by step instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Extension Manager in VS 2010 and search for Project Linker.</li>
<li>Install Project Linker extension</li>
<li>Create new solution, say Castle.Core-SL</li>
<li>Add to this solution the existent Castle.Core project (targeted for NET 4 Client Profile)</li>
<li>Add to solution new Silverlight 4 project, named Castle.Core-SL</li>
<li>Click on Castle.Core-SL project and from context menu choose “Add project link…”</li>
<li>In “Select Source Project” dialog choose the Castle.Core project, click OK.</li>
<li>To verify that projects are linked correctly, in VS Project menu choose “Edit links”: Source Project should be set to “Castle.Core”, and Target Project – “Castle.Core-SL”.</li>
<li>In order to trigger real linking process (Project Linker is observing file changes in source project) I have a trick for you. Go to Castle.Core project, then select all folders containing source files (Components.DictionaryAdapter, Core and DynamicProxy) and click on “Exclude from project” in context menu. Then, after enabling “Show all files” options, add them back. Here Project Linker will kick in and will link all added source files to Target Project.</li>
</ol>


<p>Then, we can do the same for project containing unit tests.</p>

<p>In case of Castle.Core there is another manual intervention required: filter out CastleBuild.snk file from being linked. To do that you have to open project file for your project and find an attribute in it called ProjectLinkerExcludeFilter. Add to the end of that value the string “;.snk”. After that you should “Ad As Link” the key file manually.</p>

<p>If you want to “re-sync” both projects, you have to repeat only the 9th step.</p>

<p>Now, you’ll have your Castle.Core targeted to Silverlight with all source files from original .NET project. You’re now should be confortable enough exploring the code in Visual Studio and, why not, contribute&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Since we’re writing an Out-Of-Browser Silverlight application, we want it to look and behave like a normal windows app. One of the first things I’m adding to new apps, is saving Window’s position and size and reloading them when application starts next time. So, when user launches the app again, it will find the app same size and position as before</p>

<p>In WPF that’s done pretty straightforward and it just works! For Silverlight 4 it took me already half of the day, and it’s not done yet&#8230;</p>

<p>To save MainWindow’s position and size in Silverlight 4 you can attach to MainWindow’s Closing event where you can pick values for current size and position. Then, when loading app next time, in Application’s Startup event we can <em>try load </em>previous values.</p>

<p>Where’s the catch? Width and Height are set properly, while setting Left and Top properties has NO EFFECT. Then, if the window is “snapped” to margins (in Windows 7,  maximized for full screen&#8217;s  height, leaving width the same) it will not be able to restore to previous  height, saying that value is out of bounds.</p>

<p>The code, very simple and straightforward:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainWindowSettings
{
    public static void Initialize()
    {
        if(!Application.Current.IsRunningOutOfBrowser)
            return;
        if (!Application.Current.HasElevatedPermissions)
            return;
        Initialize(Application.Current.MainWindow);
    }
    private static void Initialize(Window mainWindow)
    {
        var appSettings = new ApplicationSettings();
        var settings = appSettings.Read&lt;Settings&gt;(Settings.Key, null);
        if (settings != null)
        {
            mainWindow.WindowState = settings.WindowState;
            if (settings.WindowState != WindowState.Maximized)
            {
                mainWindow.Height = settings.Height;
                mainWindow.Width = settings.Width;
                mainWindow.Top = settings.Top;
                mainWindow.Left = settings.Left;
            }
        }
        mainWindow.Closing += (sender, args) =&gt;
        {
            var windowSettings = new Settings
            {
                Height = mainWindow.Height,
                Width = mainWindow.Width,
                Top =  mainWindow.Top,
                Left = mainWindow.Left,
                WindowState = mainWindow.WindowState
            };
            new ApplicationSettings().Write(Settings.Key, windowSettings);
        };
    }
    public class Settings
    {
        public const string Key = "MainWindowSettings";
        public Settings()
        {
            WindowState = WindowState.Normal;
        }
        public double Width { get; set; }
        public double Height { get; set; }
        public double Top { get; set; }
        public double Left { get; set; }
        public WindowState WindowState { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anybody have a clue? An advice, other than “wait Silverlight v. Next”?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I&#8217;ve copy/pasted this code in new empty app and discovered that saving Top&amp;Left values is working as it should. But the problem with &#8220;snap&#8221; is still here. Googling it revealed that <a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/204612/479374.aspx">I&#8217;m not alone</a> facing this <a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/199966/466463.aspx">issue</a>. So, waiting Silverlight v. Next&#8230;</p>

		<p>Going deeply into Silverlight development I’ve hit a bump that have destabilized me.</p>

<p>I’m at the point where I want to begin write unit tests for a Silverlight app.</p>

<p>Until this moment, NUnit, Resharper and TeamCity were working formidably well in this regard, covering all my needs: I’ve been productive writing tests and tools were at the hand to pick them up &amp; run. That’s when targeting .NET Framework.</p>

<p>If we’re back to Silverlight, major unit test frameworks are not ready. Silverlight support is either announced or present in some experimental state. And if even I’ll found a way to <strong>write my tests</strong>, Resharper and TeamCity will not be able to <strong>run them automatically</strong>, requiring manual tweaks or installing additional things.</p>

<p>Looking deeper for a solution&#8230;</p>

		<p>Despite my <a href="/blog/2009/11/26/alt-net-swiss-community-its-running/">enthusiasm about finding and participating</a> in a regional .NET user group, the <a href="http://www.altnetfr.org/lausanne/">Alt.NET Suisse</a> haven’t got enough traction to keep on rolling and now it’s actually not functioning.</p>

<p>So, to keep my community-and-knowledge-hungry spirit quiet, I <a href="/blog/2010/01/31/have-been-in-the-aliens-camp-twice/">keep visiting regional Java User Groups</a>. The last two session I’ve took part where on some emerging topics, not strictly related to Java. For me, a .NET developer, that is a ticket to visit these meetings.</p>

<p>The “<strong>Not only SQL (NoSQL)</strong>” session at <a href="http://jugl.ch/">JUG Lausanne</a> on September 9, was interesting not by presentation about NoSQL and the hype around it, but by half-way discussion that hijacked permanently the presentation. But at the end, it was not a bad thing. It was very interesting to hear how people are planning to use or already using NoSQL in real world projects.</p>

<p>“<strong>Hibernate – strategies for caching and data loading</strong>” was yesterday at <a href="http://www.genevajug.ch/">JUG Geneve</a>. The topic was somewhat familiar for me, as we’re using extensively <a href="http://nhforge.org">NHibernate</a> in our projects. Initially, NHibernate was a .NET port of popular Java ORM – Hibernate. They are still very similar in concepts, features and scope, but I do see that NHibernate got new features that were not ported from his big brother. Linq provider, Futures, fluent/code mapping are first that are coming in my mind.</p>

<p>Few random thoughts and impressions after the session:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing new for me, but a good recapitulation of options available to improve performance of your data layer</li>
<li>I do like C# over Java as a general purpose programming language. It’s easier to read, laconic and just cleaner when compared to Java</li>
<li>are the Java guys really struck into XML? I’ve seen yesterday more XML than in whole last few months</li>
<li>Alain Helaili, the presenter, used dynaTrace to show how various tweaks are affecting performance in test cases. It’s a kind of instrumentation framework for Java that has an integration point with Hibernate. Functionality is in some parts similar to latest improvements in Visual Studio 2010, IntelliTrace debugging. And it’s a typical example of “developer oriented interface” with all corresponding usability quirks</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, I’m very pleased meeting Java community. Looking forward to next sessions that are not too java-centric to make interest for a mere .NET Developer.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Dmitry Fadeyev is writing about <a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2010/09/24/false-simplicity/">icons in UI and the false sense of simplicity</a> icons are giving us.</p>

<p>While he is talking about it in the context of concrete application, it remembered me transition from “traditional” toolbars to Ribbon bar, particularly in Office apps. Still, lots of people didn’t get the sense of the Ribbon, but I consider it as an improvement. The biggest advantage is <strong>feature discoverability</strong>.</p>

<p>Lets look at two screenshots. The first one:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2010/toolbars-traditional.png" alt="alt traditional toolbars" /></p>

<p>First one is from Visual Studio 2010, a very traditional toolbar. Of course, there are other icons that being simple and intuitive give you enough confidence clicking them (think changing text alignment in Word). But to get a sense what will clicking on a unknown button will do you either will:</p>

<ul>
<li>get with mouse over it and read the tooltip (and you’re lucky if you have one, lots of application developers are not even bothering writing them)</li>
<li>click the button and observe what happens</li>
<li>forget the button and go to the menu and actually read trough menu items to find what are you looking for</li>
</ul>


<p>Hmm, of course, over time you get more confortable with clicking on the buttons that look familiarly or are used often. But finding the features are still a pain.</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2010/toolbars-windows8.png" alt="alt windows 8 toolbars" /></p>

<p>And then second screenshot showing a fragment of a Ribbon bar. We’re having here not only icons, but also a small label giving an instant hint for what the action will do. Then you even have an sense of the context, these actions are related to “Editing” the document. Click target is bigger than a 6x6 icon. And there are other advantages&#8230;</p>

<p>Yet the first toolbar is looking simpler, takes less place and over time it is easy enough in use. But any time when I see a complex application with a considerable number of options and actions, I would prefer a Ribbon instead. It’s about <strong>discoverability</strong>. It’s about <strong>first impression your application is giving to a new user</strong>. If you screw that, you’ll miss the user too&#8230;</p>

<p>Still, the Ribbon it’s not a panacea. It is not suitable for any kind of applications. Document oriented interfaces are genuinely fine for the Ribbon. But when you have data intensive apps, with lots of interactions, contextual actions, flexible layout and navigation – Ribbon may be not your choice&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>When I’ve first heard about MS’s plans about it’s new mobile platform I was excited. The main reason it was the ability to develop mobile apps using known platform and tools: C#, Silverlight and Visual Studio. Ability to quick scratch an app during a weekend, put it on the phone and be using it – it <em>looked</em> nice.</p>

<p>Watching <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/egibson/Windows-Phone-7-Jump-Start-Session-1-of-12-Introduction/">Windows Phone 7 Jump Start</a> sessions make me more confident it my ability to develop applications for the platform.</p>

<p>Same time, I’m getting a bit worried about two things.</p>

<p>First one - inability to install on the phone an application that I have just wrote. It makes unhappy not only hobbyists that are writing code pieces “for fun” and, sometimes, they want to share them with their friends. But also it makes impossible to make use of the platform by a small/medium company that have created an app for their internal and private use. Inability to <strong>legally</strong> <strong>install any app</strong> on your phone – I’m not sure about it. I do understand that MS tries to protect users from potentially dangerous apps. And I understand that MS wants a “piece of cake” from every application sold for WP7. But this inevitably is stimulating “community” to create workarounds like jailbreaks, “custom firmware” and so on.</p>

<p>The second thing that worries me it’s “phone” focus. Look at the enormous success of Apple’s iPad, sold in millions last months. Tens of Android based tablets announced this fall. If Microsoft is <strong>limiting Windows Phone 7 only for smart phones, it’s a fail</strong>. Well, in a half of the year MS can announce new “tablet” platform, but it will be too late. Everyone interested will own already a iPad or an “Android pad”. Even me. At this moment I find it more practical to own a basic phone device and a 10” tablet. It just makes more sense…</p>

<p><a href="/blog/2010/04/14/microsoft-techdays-2010-geneva-day-1/">In my experience</a>, Windows 7 is not a player in tablet market nor in any other touch oriented devices. In same way how it happened with iOS and Android, Windows Phone 7 can be a good platform for a 10” tablet. But I think MS either decided do not participate, or came later. If the latter, it already lost the battle.</p>

<p>As for my “develop for a mobile/tablet device” dreams, there are few viable choices: learn new platform or try a surrogate, like <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/monodroid/">MonoDroid</a> or <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight">Moonlight</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Updated:</strong></p>

<p>Just found and want to add it to this post - <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/07/ballmer-and-microsoft-still-doesnt-get-the-ipad.ars">Ballmer (and Microsoft) still doesn&#8217;t get the iPad</a>. A very interesting analysis of relations between Microsoft and touch devices. Lots of rumors and guesses, few interesting ideas and few very precise elucidations of MS failures in this area.</p>

<p>As for the future of an eventual tablet device from Microsoft, I’ll bet on marriage between Windows Embedded CE and Metro UI. Only that can stand out of iPad and tens of Android tablets coming next year&#8230;</p>
