		<p>It’s that happy time again, a (well deserved I think) vacation. Beach, sea, great food &amp; drinks and, of course, lot’s of time to spend with family.</p>

<p>This year, along the phones, iPad &amp; notebook I’ve took a Nook Simple Touch to go trough my ever growing reading list. The first advantage of an ebook reader is that you’re sure that nobody will try to claim the device you’re reading on for playing piano, draw, do puzzles or smash those bad pigs - Nook is genuinely un-interesting for my daughters. As for reading, I enjoy very much the device. E-Ink screen is very easy for the eyes, it’s readable on direct sun and you don’t think about running out of batteries. The other advantage is that it doesn’t have the distractions of the iPad - no twitter, email &amp; browser makes reading sessions much longer and the focus stays longer on content and thinking&#8230;</p>

<h3>Reading list</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/">Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/">Don&#8217;t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability by Steve Krug</a></li>

<li>Selected chapters from <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/index.html">The Architecture of Open Source Applications</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>And will be sharing with my wife some novels in French to improve a bit my (still bad in my opinion) French language skills.</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>

<p>Downloaded the torrent with <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/Article/News/2012video">videos of all sessions from NDC 2012</a>. 25 GB of goodness, that should keep my entertained some time. Watching videos is much more time consuming action than reading a book (and, usually, less dense in information &amp; message they convey), so I’d be picking only a handful of sessions to go trough&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>After <a href="/blog/2012/06/08/new-shiny-windows-azure-taking-the-tour/">taking the tour</a> of Windows Azure, the first thing I wanted to try is the <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Web Site hosting in Azure</a>. As Microsoft is offering a free trial for 90 days and a free extension to 12 months after the trial, you can host up to 10 small web sites for free for more than 1 year! With various options for publishing it makes Azure a no-brainer to host small personal sites and experimental stuff.</p>

<h3>Publishing a web site to Azure using Git</h3>

<p>Here are the steps required to configure &amp; publish your local repository to Azure.</p>

<h4>Configure Git publishing on Azure.</h4>

<p>It’s one time operation where you need to provide a username and password for your git repositories. You’ll be asked for it for it when you’ll try to configure Git for your first site.</p>

<h4>Create your web site in Azure</h4>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-git-1.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Provide a name for your site, then I’ll take few seconds to create an instance for it.</p>

<h4>Configure the Git repository for your site</h4>

<ul>
<li>Click on the name of your site to open it’s management console</li>
<li>Click on “Set up Git publishing”</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-git-2.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>In a few seconds your site will have a git repository provisioned.</p>

<h4>Add new remote to your local Git repository</h4>

<p>Open the folder with your local git repository in a command line/PowerShell window and type:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add azure https://vcaraulean@helloworld-test.scm.azurewebsites.net/helloworld-test.git
</code></pre>

<p>Here the “azure” is the name of your remote repository and the link is the address of your repository hosted in Azure.</p>

<h4>Push your website to newly added remote in Azure</h4>

<pre><code>git push azure master
</code></pre>

<p>In a few seconds your files will be published to Azure and your site will be available online.</p>

<p>As we see, <strong>configuration process is very straightforward</strong> and simple. After setting it up it takes<strong> one command to publish</strong> last version of your site to Azure and in a few seconds it will be available online.</p>

<hr />

<p>PS: Deploying a website/application using Git is far from being a ground breaking feature as many companies are allowing similar scenarios. Important is who does it – Microsoft. The revamped Azure with all his new features, ongoing involvements in Open Source, the new wave of Developer Tools shows clearly that Microsoft isn’t only serving to “The Enterprise” but also listening carefully to latest tech &amp; software development trends. And even his moves aren’t really innovative, keeping up with new stuff and improving constantly the old products it’s a very good strategy.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>How there is a lot of buzz in last few days about <a href="http://windowsazure.com">revamped Windows Azure</a>, I cannot resist anymore and I’m giving it a try.</p>

<p>I’ve read few blog posts about new features, Metro style UI &amp; improved tooling. But I was surprised by what I have seen when I logged in and tried to open the “Manage” part: the<strong> Windows Azure Tour</strong> application.</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-tour-1.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Instead of throwing the newcomer directly into Management panel, it offers you to take a tour and get some concepts of application and how to interact with it.</p>

<p>The idea itself is not new. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant">Clippy the Office Assistant</a> is the (annoying) forgotten hero born to help people dig into Office applications. More often other companies are offering a video introduction for their products or a series of “text + screenshots” slides to quickly explain usage of the product to new users.</p>

<p>The approach Microsoft took with Windows Azure Tour is a bit different:</p>

<ul>
<li>It runs “within” application itself, giving impression of having the main application in background</li>
<li>It gradually exposes application’s features in the same window</li>
<li>Features are shown in exact same place where they are in application</li>
<li>It looks &amp; works great</li>
</ul>


<p>And I quite like their Wizard-like walkthrough dialog. Smooth and subtle animations, clear visual indication of steps and current position, a bold exposure of Metro/Windows 8 style. I’m very tempted to try reproduce it in XAML&#8230;</p>

<p>Few more screenshots:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-tour-2.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-tour-3.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Finishing the Tour will take you to the main application screen:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2012/azure-tour-4.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>That’s just my first impression about Azure. And most often is the one that counts the most. I think Microsoft have done a great job for presenting the new Azure. Let’s see now how it will be in real usage&#8230;</p>

<p>PS: If you haven’t seen the previous Azure portal, here is a screenshot:</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p><a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> was released recently and it’s a huge advancement in usability of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git SCM</a> in Windows. Until not so far existent tooling has been giving you the command line integration and hopefully some (crappy) basic UI . <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">Git Extensions</a> has made lately great progress but I still preferred the command line for routine tasks.</p>

<p>This lack of good tooling around Git was the reason why I’ve promoted Mercurial in my company when we’ve migrated some of our projects to DVCS. <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/">TortoiseHg</a> is great for working with Mercurial repositories and is evolving steadily adding new features &amp; improving stability.</p>

<p>There is one killer feature that I absolutely love in TortoiseHg and I’m using it daily. I do most of source-control operations from the command line/PowerShell. But whenever I want I can launch the TortoiseHg’s UI using simple commands that would bring me right where I need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>thg</strong> or <strong>thg log</strong>: the log window</li>
<li><strong>thg ci</strong>: commit dialog</li>
<li><strong>thg shelve</strong>: shelve dialog</li>
</ul>


<p>So, with a couple of keystrokes I can launch (almost any) dialog for a Mercurial repository in current folder, do quickly the job and close it away to be back to my lovely Console. That’s a true time saver and integrates very well in my workflow.</p>

<p>This is the feature I miss in GitHub for Windows: launch it from command line, accept command line parameters and show me the screen I’ve asked for. Isn’t it a great idea?</p>

<p>Probably it’s not easy to add this feature as for now GHfW is deployed using ClickOnce and it has enough quirks and limitations. But who knows what the future brings&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<blockquote><p>When you continuously seek out the limit, you’ll realize that it’s often much higher than you expected. Yes, you can make that screen even simpler than the bare-boned version you’re looking at. Yes, you can trust your employees much more than you imagined. Yes, you can launch without a billing system.</p><p>Once you train yourself to seek out the limit in all endeavors, you’ll get better and faster at correcting the inevitable oversteps, and hit that peak performance.</p><p>But if you never dare venture close to the limit, you’ll find that it’s shrinking all the time. There will be even more people you could possibly offend, even more bells that need whistling, ever more realities of the real world you cannot change.</p></blockquote>


<p>From <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3058-seven-degrees-of-slip">Seven degrees of slip</a>.</p>

<p>Lately one of the limits I’ve hit were advanced threading concepts in .NET. It’s an area where I haven’t stepped much aside from some rather simple use cases &amp; basic usage. But recently I had to solve few (non trivial for me) threading puzzles/exercises and today I’ve been hit by IIS showing ‘Deadlock detected’ for one of our Server components. It hurts&#8230;</p>

<p>In the same time it clearly shows a limit in my knowledge and experience. So, let’s hit it with an action plan: dig dipper in Threading. Then review those threading puzzles and sort out the deadlock out of the system.</p>

<p>Resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.albahari.com/threading/">Threading in C# by Joseph Albahari</a>. It’s a book available online for free</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/032143482X/">Concurrent Programming on Windows by Joe Duffy</a>. Paper book and Kindle from Amazon</li>
</ul>


<p>Both are well recommended on StackOverflow&#8230;</p>

		<p><a href="http://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2011/12/16/duke-nukem-unhappy-marriages-and-the-anna-karenina-principle">A good story</a> (not the main for that article):</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230; the keynote speaker shared a story about a failed project. He joined the project a couple of years into the development, and the team had yet to release anything to production. He went on to detail that he was on the project another year and a half, with no production release in sight, and left the project.</p>

<p>This project was one of those legacy re-writes, given pretty much unlimited budget and resources, in hopes that this would produce the best possible replacement for the existing product. The project had budget, resources, executive backing and visibility, technical leadership, support from domain experts etc. etc. Yet the <strong>project was still a colossal failure</strong>. Why? <strong>It never released</strong>!</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many reasons why you should release as soon as possible. But the main are to get a feedback from your target audience and validate your technical decisions. Both of them are extremely important at early development stage in order to confirm that you’re building what people will buy and you’re doing it right.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>There’s good guide on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh202979(v=vs.92">how to manage WP7’s Secondary tiles</a>.aspx) on MSDN.</p>

<p>So, how are you doing it with Caliburn.Micro? Take same way, it just works!</p>

<p>However, there’s a small touch of Caliburn.Micro goodness you can add to your code to make it more maintainable. When you’re setting the URI for your Tile, use the INavigationService.UriFor&lt;>() extension method. This will make your code a little more friendly for an eventual refactoring and for sure will save you from few nasty bugs.</p>

<p>Sample code:</p>

<pre><code>var newTileData = new StandardTileData
{
    Title = "my tile",
    BackTitle = "my tile details",
    BackContent = "description",
};

ShellTile.Create(navigationService.UriFor&lt;MyViewModel&gt;()
                     .WithParam(x =&gt; x.ViewModelParameter, "some value")
                     .BuildUri(),
                 newTileData);
</code></pre>

<p>Piece of cake!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>The Windows Phone SDK 7.1 introduced a new control to show the progress of long operations or interactions, ProgressIndicator. As I love much the <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com">Caliburn.Micro</a> framework I got some time to integrate neatly ProgressIndicator with the rest of application and services using Caliburn’s container.</p>

<p>First of all, let’s define our application facing progress service:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IProgressService {
    void Show();
    void Show(string text);
    void Hide();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty simple, yes&#8230;</p>

<p>The implementation was partly inspired by <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/07/creating-a-global-progressindicator-experience-using-the-windows-phone-7-1-sdk-beta-2/">Jeff Wilcox’s article about creating a global ProgressIndicator</a>.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple and straightforward: we’re getting the Root Application Frame and hooking up to the Navigated event. His arguments contain the page being navigated to. Then we’re attaching our instance of ProgressIndicator to that page. And the service uses Show/Hide methods to manipulate the state of indicator. The code:</p>

<pre><code>public class ProgressService : IProgressService {
    const string DefaultIndicatorText = "Loading...";
    private readonly ProgressIndicator progressIndicator;

    public ProgressService(PhoneApplicationFrame rootFrame)
    {
        progressIndicator = new ProgressIndicator {Text = DefaultIndicatorText};

        rootFrame.Navigated += RootFrameOnNavigated;
    }

    private void RootFrameOnNavigated(object sender, NavigationEventArgs args)
    {
        var content = args.Content;
        var page = content as PhoneApplicationPage;
        if (page == null)
            return;

        page.SetValue(SystemTray.ProgressIndicatorProperty, progressIndicator);
    }

    public void Show()
    {
        Show(DefaultIndicatorText);
    }

    public void Show(string text)
    {
        progressIndicator.Text = text;
        progressIndicator.IsIndeterminate = true;
        progressIndicator.IsVisible = true;
    }

    public void Hide()
    {
        progressIndicator.IsIndeterminate = false;
        progressIndicator.IsVisible = false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The last piece of this mini-puzzle is wiring up the service to container and made it available to the rest of application:</p>

<pre><code>public class AppBootstrapper : PhoneBootstrapper {
    private PhoneContainer container;

    protected override void Configure()
    {
        container = new PhoneContainer(RootFrame);
        container.Instance&lt;IProgressService&gt;(new ProgressService(RootFrame));
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all. Now declare a dependency on IProgressService whenever you need it and show/hide to give a nice feedback to the User when your application is doing something long. You never forget that User is the ultimate chief and judge in our business, right?..</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I have recently published new project on GitHub, <a href="http://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile">WcfWithoutConfigFile</a>. This post is intended as a ‘readme’ file for this repository.</p>

<p>It’s just a collection of simple projects that I’ve put together when a coworker asked me to show how he can use WCF without configuration files. He got feed up working with XML in web.config and wanted a cleaner and more understandable way to configure Windows Communication Foundation.</p>

<p>What’s in:</p>

<ul>
<li>How to use WCF in your unit tests (<a href="http://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile/tree/master/WcfWithoutConfigFile.Tests">WcfWithoutConfigFile.Tests</a> project). Sometimes you want to get your code tested at service boundaries and you want to involve also WCF. It contains, among a simple unit test, a base class for your tests so the test cases are clean and don’t contain plumbing code.</li>
<li>Hosting WCF services in IIS (<a href="http://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile/tree/master/WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost">WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost</a> project). Defining the service in .svc files and all required infrastructure to instantiate the service via code-only configuration.</li>
<li><strong>My favorite</strong> – hosting WCF service in IIS using Castle’s <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/facilities/trunk/wcf/index.html">WcfIntegration facility</a> (<a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile/tree/master/WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle">WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle</a> project). It leverages Castle Windsor container and WcfFacility to easily host/run/consume your WCF services. It also configures the service to use Windows authentication and shows how to retrieve client’s WindowsIdentity in the service. There is also a client project, <a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile/tree/master/WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle-Client">WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle-Client</a> that connects to service and does some operations.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/WcfWithoutConfigFile/tree/master/WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle">WcfWithoutConfigFile.WebHost.Castle</a> requires some configuration to get it working properly. Be sure to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run it in IIS Express</li>
<li>Enable Windows Authentication in project properties</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>There is a lot of panic in Microsoft eco-system caused by some <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/will-there-be-a-silverlight-6-and-does-it-matter/11180">rumors that Silverlight 5 will be the last of the family</a>. Developers are crying about skills being buried and managers fearing about the future of in-house enterprise apps.</p>

<p>And everyone is guessing what will be Microsoft pushing in the segment currently occupied by Silverlight. Now we have two available options, the new guy in the block - the HTML 5, and the good old and trusty WPF. Won’t mention Windows 8 here as it’s way to the Enterprise is too long to be considered as an option.</p>

<p>So, everyone is watching the next move of Microsoft as there is not a clear winner – HTML 5 is too young to be considered seriously and WPF is too old to be considered as a long-time investment. When Silverlight was a competitor <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/05/flex-silverlight-html5-time-to-decide/">the choice was rather easy</a>, now <a href="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/11/the-untimely-demise-of-the-plugin-and-how-lob-developments-will-suffer/">picture is much more blurred</a>.</p>

<h2>In my view</h2>

<p>XAML &amp; .NET will stay with us. Will it be WPF, Metro or anything MS will roll out for Desktop and LOB applications it will be based on those two pillars. At least for 7-10 years we’re assured.</p>

<p>I’ll make few guesses, what MS’s steps will be after Silverlight end will be announced (it will be interesting to read it in a year or two):</p>

<ul>
<li>A promise that Silverlight 5 will be supported for next 3-4 years</li>
<li>Actively encouraging developers to migrate Silverlight apps to WPF</li>
<li>Newer versions of WPF will promote features previously hyped as Silverlight’s exclusives (in-browser apps, sandboxing, web deployment &amp; updates and others) minus the ability to run in browsers on various platforms.</li>
</ul>


<p>As for companies struggling with the choice right now (and it will probably true for near future), you’ll have to decide:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interaction and Data intensive applications, Rich User Experience, Resource Intensive application, deep OS integration – embrace the WPF and be happy (if you don’t mind to lock yourself to MS and Windows).</li>
<li>Platform independent, high user base, moderately interactive UIs, presentation and manipulation of small amounts of data – your best bet is the Web: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript will be your tools.</li>
</ul>


<p>And if you still struggle with the choice the best thing you can do next is to look at your current development team. If they are more experienced and efficient with Web technologies you’re set. If they are mostly Desktop specialists then you’d want to explore their productivity to the max and get the release date closer. You’re sorted.</p>

<p><strong>And the last word</strong>: don’t be a mono-disciplinary developer. Don’t lock yourself exclusively in Desktop or Web, Microsoft or LAMP or whatever. The day you’ll fail to pick, learn and use efficiently a new tool/framework will mean your career as a Professional Software Developer is done. Be open. Look around, there are so many amazing things in Software Development industry. Just pick something new and learn. It will be one of the best investments you can do in your future. You can do it right now&#8230;</p>
