  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Learning</h3>

<p>There is only one way that can make you better specialist - learning. Continuous learning will continuously improve your skills, change work perception and increase satisfaction you have doing your daily job. If you want to jump over mediocrity you have no other way than improve yourself. Daily.</p>

<h3>DDD</h3>

<p>Being interested in Domain Driven Design (DDD) lately and writing more and more code this way I found today a <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/archive/tags/DDD/default.aspx">nice series of blog posts about DDD</a> done by <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/casey/default.aspx">Casey Charlton</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Until last week I was indifferent to podcasts. Not really indifferent - I knew they exists, a lot of people likes them, they&#8217;re about things that sometimes are interesting for me. But I had absolutely no time to listen to them&#8230; Blogs &amp; mailing lists are my choice to feed my knowledge and laziness demons&#8230;</p>

<p>Being car-less lately, offered me an opportunity to dig into podcast&#8217;s world. In my 30-40 minutes commuting I&#8217;ve start listening to audio feeds. So far, my preferred are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://altnetpodcast.com/">Alt.NET Podcast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering Radio</a></li>
<li><a href="http://elegantcode.com/category/codecast/">Elegant Code Cast</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Despite relatively slow informational flow and manageability (it&#8217;s way easier to re-read a phrase than rewind an audio stream for an interesting passage, or diagonal read versus jump back &amp; forth to skip something) podcasts made my commuting a bit more enjoyable.</p>

<p>An Update: Scott Hanselman (the author of Hanselminutes cited earlier) is asking his readers about their favorite developer-oriented podcasts, and publishing his own favorites: <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselmanListOfPodcastsForNETProgrammers.aspx">Hanselman List of Podcasts for .NET Programmers</a>. Very impressive list to compliment my own.</p>

<p>Happy listening&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Very often you&#8217;re going over a description of some function or new feature and just notice in your mind, &#8220;nice feature&#8221; without seeing a real application for it. Later, you&#8217;re coming with scenario where the trick you&#8217;ve read days ago will fit perfectly.</p>

<p>That was the case when I&#8217;ve seen earlier in <a href="http://www.tunatoksoz.com/">Tuna Toksoz</a>&#8217;s weblog a <a href="http://www.tunatoksoz.com/post/NHibernate-hbm2ddl.aspx">description of &#8220;hbm2ddl.auto&#8221; property</a>. Few days ago, I&#8217;ve put it to work in a way that makes me feel better. By the way, the particular reason that made me happy was that I&#8217;ve deleted a lot of repetitive code from our code base.</p>

<h4>How you can use hbm2ddl.auto property in unit tests</h4>

<p>Our integration tests are run over a real database. For each test we&#8217;re re-creating the database, so that each test will be ran in separation and without interfering with results of previous tests. Also, things are a bit complicated since we&#8217;re working with few databases at the same time, each with his own schema. Before, each test had to use SchemaExport class that exported the database schema built from NHibernate configuration on the way deleting your old database/schema/data. So, each integration test class had same method to call. Redundant and repetitive. Yes, you can make a base class that will do that, but you have to inherit then all tests from that class.</p>

<p><strong>How it works now:</strong> in session configuration (usually in app.config for integration test project) you put:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;property name="hbm2ddl.auto"&gt;create&lt;/property&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; and you&#8217;re set. Each time your code will build a new SessionFactory, NHibernate will call:</p>

<pre><code>new SchemaExport(cfg).Create(false, true);
</code></pre>

<p>This way, before the SessionFactory will be built, your database will be refreshed with a new schema and tests will run in a clean database.</p>

<p>One line of code instead of tens or hundreds. Isn&#8217;t that a good trick?!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1414-a-complex-system-that-works-is-invariably">37signals</a> quoted:</p>

<blockquote><p>A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.</p>

<p>— John Gall</p></blockquote>

<p>Reading this remind me principles of agile software development, &#8220;release early, release often&#8221; way of Open Source Software world and my own indestructible certainty in the fact that a simple working software released today is much better than a complex and over-engineered beast to-be-released-when-it-is-done.</p>

<p>A software is always a solution. Let&#8217;s build first a solution of client&#8217;s problem, thereafter we&#8217;ll add to application all that crap backed in typical business application, like report designers, integration points with 10 external systems and data export in 100 formats. Do the core. Release it. Then go back and do the rest 80% of application that will be used by less than 20% of customers.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2008-10-03T18:18:43+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 3<span>rd</span>, 2008</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In our projects we&#8217;re using Castle&#8217;s Automatic Transaction Management facility (ATM). This facility allows to declaratively define transaction boundaries: by marking a method by a specific attribute the call to this method will be wrapped in a transaction, so that a transaction will be opened before calling the method and committed right after finishing method execution.</p>

<p>In code, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[Transactional]
public class Foo
{
    [Transaction]
    public virtual void Bar()
    {
        // Do something in a transaction
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#8217;s suppose that later, we want to test this code. Say, we want to verify that code in Foo.Bar() method is executed in a transaction. Moreover, we want to assure that the marking attributes will not be deleted accidentally.</p>

<p>We can test that within two aspects. First - an integration test: a real application part will be spawned and a call will be performed. After, we should verify that changes was committed by transaction. It takes time to run such a test (integration test usually runs slower) and effort to write &amp; verify such a test. Second way to test that - is to check presence or required attributes. This will be a fast unit test that will just check that attribute is still applied to a method.</p>

<p>Those methods complements each other. Ideally, it should be both written.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see how we can verify that attributes required by ATM are applied to required methods.</p>

<p>First, we&#8217;ve defined the API that we want to use to do our check:</p>

<pre><code>CustomAssertions.ShouldUseATM&lt;Foo&gt;(foo =&gt; foo.Bar());
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, you see it right, we want to make it type save, refactor-able and nice looking.</p>

<p>This helper class should verify next assumptions, all required by ATM:
  * Tested class should be marked with TransactionalAttribute;
  * Method should be marked by TransactionAttribute;
  * Method should be virtual.</p>

<p>Solution we came to this problem is the next class:</p>

<pre><code>public static partial class CustomAssertions
{
    public static void ShouldUseATM&lt;T&gt;(Expression&lt;Action&lt;T&gt;&gt; methodExpression) where T : class 
    {
        ThrowIfTypeNotMarkedAsTransactional(typeof (T));

        var methodInfo = ((MethodCallExpression) methodExpression.Body).Method;

        ThrowIfMethodIsNotMarkedWithTransactionAttribute(methodInfo);
        ThrowIfMethodMarkedWithTransactionAttributeIsVirtual(methodInfo);
    }

    private static void ThrowIfTypeNotMarkedAsTransactional(Type classType)
    {
        object[] foundAttributes = classType.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(TransactionalAttribute), false);
        if  (foundAttributes.Length == 0)
            Assert.Fail("The type '{0}' is not marked with [Transactional] attribute", classType.Name);
    }

    private static void ThrowIfMethodIsNotMarkedWithTransactionAttribute(MethodInfo info)
    {
        var found = info.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(TransactionAttribute), false);
        if (found.Length == 0)
            Assert.Fail("Method '{0}' from '{1}' type is not marked with [Transaction] attribute",
                       info.Name,
                       info.DeclaringType.Name);
    }

    private static void ThrowIfMethodMarkedWithTransactionAttributeIsVirtual(MethodBase methodInfo)
    {
        if  (methodInfo.IsVirtual &amp;&amp; !methodInfo.IsFinal)
            return;

        Assert.Fail("Method '{0}' from '{1}' type is marked with [Transaction] attribute, but is not declared as virtual.",
                    methodInfo.Name,
                    methodInfo.DeclaringType.Name);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So far, we&#8217;re pleased with how it works for us.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As always, business requirement went over existing code base to ask for a minor change that wasn&#8217;t compatible with our existing infrastructure: all surrogate keys are unique identifiers (Guid) and all infrastructure was built around that. The business people asked to add to an existing domain entity a natural key - integer identity number (auto increment field), to serve as a reference number.</p>

<p>We had two choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>to generate the identity from business code</li>
<li>to let database manage it for us.</li>
</ul>


<p>The second approach it preferable for us because it&#8217;s the database&#8217;s job to generate the keys.</p>

<p>Out of the box NHibernate doesn&#8217;t support such a thing. Answers to my question in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers?hl=en">NHibernate Users discussion group</a> led to the next solution.</p>

<p>Given the class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Entity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int Id2 { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First &#8220;Id&#8221; is the primary key, the second is the key that we want to map to identity column. To have that done we should do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Map &#8220;Id2&#8221; property as &#8220;generated&#8221;</li>
<li>Use &#8220;database-object&#8221; to drop the column generated by NHibernate &amp; create new one, with IDENTITY set on.</li>
</ul>


<p>The complete mapping:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;hibernate-mapping xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
    namespace="NHibernate.Playground"
    assembly="NHibernate.Playground"
    default-lazy="false" xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2"&gt;
  &lt;class name="Entity"&gt;
    &lt;id name="Id"&gt;
      &lt;generator class="increment" /&gt;
    &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;property name="Id2" type="int" generated="always" insert="false" /&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;
  &lt;database-object&gt;
    &lt;create&gt;
      ALTER TABLE Entity DROP COLUMN Id2
      ALTER TABLE Entity ADD Id2 INT IDENTITY
    &lt;/create&gt;
    &lt;drop&gt;
      ALTER TABLE Entity DROP COLUMN Id2
    &lt;/drop&gt;
  &lt;/database-object&gt;
&lt;/hibernate-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I like the flexibility offered by NHibernate. Even if you don&#8217;t have required feature, you can always use naked ADO.NET or raw SQL.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>AnkhSVN</h4>

<p>A mate came on me with &#8220;I found a wonderful SVN client which works from Visual Studio. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/">AnkhSVN</a>&#8221;. When I tried it last time it was in version 1.x, ugly &amp; buggy. Having a well working TortoiseSVN I had no regrets uninstalling it.</p>

<p>Lately it passed a major update. It looks nicer, integrates well in VS and has all functions required for day-by-day work with Subversion. The mate who recommended it said that he found no problems during a week of trying it.</p>

<p>Ok. Having a refactoring to do that will involve moving few files I decided to give it a try. Moving/renaming files is one of the pain points when working with TortoiseSVN. After committing my changes to repository, the TeamCity server failed to build the project - few files was missing or had unmodified content when it should. AnkhSVN didn&#8217;t committed all changed files to repository. In VS they was shown as unmodified, but TortoiseSVN show them as changed files. A commit from TortoiseSVN has fixed the problem.</p>

<p>Still in doubts about it, worth keeping or not&#8230;</p>

<h4>MBUnit Plugin for Resharper</h4>

<p>I wanted to run test suite of Rhino.Mocks which uses MBUnit. First try - installed last version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mbunit-resharper/">MBUnit plugin for Resharper</a>. It worked nice when I run a single test fixture. But failed to find any tests when I choose &#8220;Run Unit Tests&#8221; from context menu of a project or solution. Uninstalled.</p>

<h4>Gallio Automation platform</h4>

<p>Still wanted to run the Rhino.Mocks&#8217;s unit tests, installed <a href="http://www.gallio.org/">Gallio</a> a bundle that contains among others the MBUnit, a standalone test runner and yet another MBUnit integration into Resharper&#8217;s Test Runner. Results:</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration with Resharper: didn&#8217;t discovered all test from test project, cannot run those discovered.</li>
<li>Standalone test runner - cannot run test suite, FixtureExecutionException.</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two tools concerns MBUnit. All I wanted to do is just to run quickly a test suite. I can do it from console, but it&#8217;s painful and I want to do it from VS and have results there. I can do it with TestDriven.NET - but I don&#8217;t like it because found it too intrusive in my work environment. I think this is the reason why we haven&#8217;t moved to MBUnit from NUnit. It&#8217;s it superior as unit test framework, but weak tooling support make it unusable for us.</p>

<p>&amp; no time now to check what is not working and how to fix it. May be later&#8230;</p>

<p>PS: I&#8217;ve seen it one more time: It&#8217;s very important the very first impression about something to be positive. If somebody tries your software and it blows up or doesn&#8217;t do what is it about, you fail. But this is another story&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally, the goal of integration tests is to verify that different application parts are glued well together and interacts as expected. Thus, they are a bit different thing from unit tests that tends to test how a small, separate part is acting. Below are two tests that I can&#8217;t classify to be pure integration tests because they touch a sensible part of application/infrastructure configuration like Windsor&#8217;s configuration files and NHibernate&#8217;s mappings. These simple tests can save a lot of time at very initial development stage when application bits are changed frequently and later, as a guarantee that you&#8217;ve not broken something in a recent refactoring.</p>

<h4>Can_resolve_all_services_in_container()</h4>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/default.aspx">Bill Simser</a> wrote some time ago about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/2008/06/04/the-first-spec-you-should-write-when-using-castle.aspx">the first test to be written when using Castle&#8217;s Windsor Container</a>. It&#8217;s a real gem that let&#8217;s you verify if any of services registered in container can be resolved (have all required dependencies). Here is it, a bit improved for skipping verification for generic types, since, at that moment, we don&#8217;t know the generic argument for type to be constructed:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void Can_resolve_all_services_in_container()
{
    var container = new WindsorContainer("container.xml");
    foreach (IHandler handler in container.Kernel.GetAssignableHandlers(typeof(object)))
    {
        if (handler.ComponentModel.Service.IsGenericType)
            continue;

        container.Resolve(handler.ComponentModel.Service);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Can_compile_NHibernate_mapping_configuration()</h4>

<p>This test was sitting for a long time in our codebase, but I&#8217;ve seen it recently in <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/archive/2008/06/17/test-your-nhibernate-mappings.aspx">this post</a> of <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/default.aspx">David Larebee</a>. I wrote it in times when writing our first mappings and the only one way to verify if you don&#8217;t have any faults was to write one of CRUD operations and run the test. But that&#8217;s a long process. Shorter response cycle is always better. Here it is:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void Can_compile_NHibernate_mapping_configuration()
{
    ISessionFactory factory =
        new Configuration()
            .Configure()
            .AddAssembly("MyApp.MyDomainAssembly")
            .BuildSessionFactory();

    Assert.IsNotNull(factory);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This test suppose that you have HNibernate configuration in your app.config and tries to register all mappings from given assembly file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This time it&#8217;s about useful macro that speeds up writing test names. Although we&#8217;re not using yet BDD development style (BDD is for Behavior Driven Design) I like to give to my test BDD-style names. You know, something like:</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void When_user_pressed_OK_message_should_be_prepared_and_sent()
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>Writing down these names, when words are separated by underscores is not easy and error prone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/">Jean-Paul S. Boodhoo</a> has posted in his blog an updated macro for formatting test names in BDD-style manner:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/archive/2008/04/14/bdd-test-naming-macro-speed-update.aspx">BDD Test Naming Macro - Speed Update</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Using this macro you can write test name as an usual sentence, having words separated by spaces. After running the macro it will replace all space characters by underscores.</p>

<p>For me it was first macro written for Visual Studio, but after some rambling within VS I have the macro running and working well. Thereafter, found these links than can help to setup and use VS macros:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems to be that Patterns &amp; Practices team continues to do what they do the best - creating guidance within different development areas.</p>

<p>The last release of this group is the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WCFSecurity/">WCF Security Guidance</a>. It contains description for a few application scenarios &amp; a list of various How-Tos, including few video walkthroughs of common WCF solutions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s different from usual way to dig into WCF infrastructure details. It&#8217;s not crawling over hundreds of MSDN pages, it&#8217;s not like reading MSDN samples trying to understand what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<p>It is a very detailed step-by-step description on how to do some tasks touching different aspects of WCF, starting from opening a certificates store, and ending with deployment advices.</p>

<p>Keep it going, P&amp;P!</p>
