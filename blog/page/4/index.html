  <div class="entry-content"><p>Writing is (still) one of the important skills for anybody engaged in IT. <a href="/blog/2010/03/15/all-is-starting-with-a-cv/">I wrote about it</a> more than one year ago when I had to go over a bunch of CVs. I haven&#8217;t changed my mind since and it’s still a problem for me and a good part of non-native English speakers.</p>

<p>Yes, the problem is worse if English isn&#8217;t your first language. And not even the second. For me it’s fighting with French for third place. But it&#8217;s the &#8216;default&#8217; in IT industry. So, you may like it or not but in order to enjoy some interesting career opportunities you have to know how to use it properly.</p>

<p>One of the goals why I started this blog was to practice writing in English. It worked well. It worked so nice that now I’m thinking to start one in French. I remember writing first posts, every one took hours to write and rewrite. Now it’s much more easy, if you have something to say you just put it down. It just flows. This gave me an amazing opportunity to easily engage in discussions here and there in the Web and profit enormously from this experience.</p>

<p>But I still think my English is not good enough and I’ve been sad because of lack of the time to improve it.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/index.html">The Writer’s Handbook</a>. God bless the (forgotten) place where I’ve spotted this site. It’s a book composed from small chapters on how to improve your Writing. The format and style (small, to the point, no clutter) makes it possible to read it whenever you have few minutes: in the morning, warming-up before going hunt that bug, enjoying a cup of tea in the evening. And that’s what I’m doing.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Ruslan Rusu (<a href="http://twitter.com/ruslanrusu">@ruslanrusu</a>) shared a link to a <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php">chapter</a> from <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real by 37signals</a>, here is a fragment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hire good writers</p><p>If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position, always hire the better writer. It doesn&#8217;t matter if that person is a designer, programmer, marketer, salesperson, or whatever, the writing skills will pay off. Effective, concise writing and editing leads to effective, concise code, design, emails, instant messages, and more.</p><p>That&#8217;s because being a good writer is about more than words. Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else&#8217;s shoes. They know what to omit. They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need.</p><footer><strong>37signals</strong> <cite><a href='http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Wordsmiths.php'>Getting Real, Wordsmiths</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve bee watching <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Windows-Phone-7/Windows-Phone-7-Announcements--Demos-from-MIX-11-with-Joe-Belfiore">Channel 9 with WP7 announcements</a> and there are very interesting things that are coming to the platform, both developer and end-user oriented. In no particular order, with my comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Jump list (on letters using LongListSelector) and app search directly in application list</strong>. It&#8217;s a welcome change. When number of installed apps is past of 30-40, it&#8217;s very hard to find quickly the right app. I&#8217;ve tried to imagine a solution for this problem and came to idea that MS will let user&#8217;s create &#8220;folder&#8221; tiles to group apps, similarly to iOS. How will work solution from MS we&#8217;ll see when Mango will be released.</li>
<li><strong>Marketplace improvements and better search</strong>. Another much welcomed change. Whenever I had to find something in Marketplace I would rather fire up Zune if it&#8217;s available. Same, Games Hub is nice addition.</li>
<li><strong>Third party apps integrated in search</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved hardware interoperability</strong>. Camera, gyro, compass. I&#8217;m cool for this stuff.</li>
<li><strong>Improved live tiles</strong>. You can &#8220;pin&#8221; part of your apps to a tile. Extremely powerful feature, if done right (by developer). Then you have animations and status updates on a tile, directly from the app and not a remote service.</li>
<li><strong>MULTITASKING</strong>. I&#8217;ve been waiting for it. &#8220;Only back&#8221; navigation isn&#8217;t the greatest experience when you&#8217;re trying to do few things at the same time. App switching speed is very impressive. I&#8217;ve seen demos of Blackberry&#8217;s PlayBook based on QNX and running few resource heavy games at once and I&#8217;ve beed astounded by how system manages that. I&#8217;m glad to see that WP7 offers similar experience.</li>
<li><strong>Sockets &amp; low level network API</strong>. Skype is coming. Hope to see a decent IM app supporting ICQ &amp; GTalk soon. And a VoIP/Softphone client too&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>SQL CE database</strong>. Good to have, may be useful for data intensive apps &amp; offline capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>IE9 &amp; HTML5</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, Microsoft took a slow start strategy with Windows Phone 7. Got it out robust but low on features if compared with iOS &amp; Android. Made first update (the NoDo) to make small improvements and polish the update process itself. And Mango will be coming this year to put it on par with competitors. When you add to the game the power of Microsoft&#8217;s marketing machine, strong partner relationships and Nokia deal, then forecasts about WP7 getting over iPhone by 2015 sound very realistic.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Web technologies are one of gray areas in my career as a professional Software Engeneer. Historically, since I started working closely with .NET platform (2004 I think) I&#8217;ve been involved in server side and desktop development, my last mile in user interactions were WinForms, WPF and now Silverlight.</p>

<p>And even if I understand principles of Web technologies, giving I know what things are how they are used, my real experience with development for Web is limited to WCF services hosted in IIS. I don&#8217;t have a finalised project done from ground up with any of modern Web development techics.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I really enjoyed watching today the Mix11&#8217;s Web Platform keynote. I know it&#8217;s a demo. I know that samples were extremely simplistic. I know that real world requirements are cruel. But I&#8217;m trully amazed by how fast basic things are done. You have a dabase backed site running in minutes. You can pick and customize a CMS and while your coup of coffee isn&#8217;t finished yet you&#8217;re filling the site with content. Entity Framework 4.1 looks very appealing with it&#8217;s code first approach. ASP.NET MVC3 scaffolding makes shaping your apps very fast. Oh, and HTML 5, of course&#8230;</p>

<p>And I&#8217;m impressed how Microsoft accepted Open Source projects as a part of development ecosystem. Just look how seamless OSS offerings/products are integrated in WebMatrix. Take a look at open source package management system - NuGet - filled up with thousands of freely available packages. If you add also it&#8217;s own projects that MS is publishing with a open source licence, it&#8217;s pretty clear that MS tries to keep up with community and support not only &#8220;enterprise&#8221; vendors but also mere mortals, you and me.</p>

<p>Also looking forward for tommorow&#8217;s keynote. I hope there will be some great announcements for Windows Phone platform. I&#8217;m missing very few things, net sockets and multitasking being most wanted. And a legal way to sideload an application will make me (and some enterprises) very happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h5><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I’ve wrote this guide for my teammates that started diving in Mercurial. They came with Subversion background and after looking how they are working with Mercurial I wanted to show them one of more flexible workflows. It’s not a definitive guide. Just <strong>one of the ways</strong> to manage multiple work items with Mercurial and TortoiseHg 2.0. Oh, and it’s illustrated&#8230;</h5>

<h2>The Story, a real one&#8230;</h2>

<p>One of the devs was working on a feature and wanted to push it to remote repository. Feature, being incomplete/not finished/full of bugs makes using some parts of the app awkward. And/or it’s keeping out other devs working in same source code area. Or the developer wants just push it and go fix an annoying bug he just spotted in other area&#8230;</p>

<h4>What to do?</h4>

<p>First of all, don’t keep it local! You should <strong>not try keep your modifications local</strong>. Mostly because your PC is not as reliable as our servers and also work you do isn’t visible to other team members.</p>

<p>Let’s formulate the problem: <strong>have ability to manage few work items simultaneously</strong>.</p>

<h4>When it’s useful?</h4>

<ul>
<li>A piece of work (issue/ticket/feature/bug) you’re tackling currently can take multiple days to implement. Even weeks.</li>
<li>Multiple work items are useful when you have to quickly fix a bug in ‘default’ line when keep working on another feature</li>
<li>You can share your unfinished work or ask an advice/review on it from your teammates</li>
<li>You want to do something experimental, a crazy idea to try and then throw it to recycle bin.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Solution?</h4>

<p>One of the options is use<strong> Mercurial named branches</strong>. I’ll describe a small workflow (with pictures, so you don’t get bored) describing how you can manage multiple work items at the same time.</p>

<p>Here is the algorithm, to get you on the track. It’s command line log with commentaries:</p>

<pre><code>hg branch ticket-17                        // creating branch ‘ticket-17’
(do some changes)
hg commit –m “my commit message”           // committing to the branch
(more work, more commits)
hg update default                          // switching to default line
hg merge ticket-17                         // merging branch ‘ticket-17’ to default line
hg commit                                  // committing your merge
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s all. I hope you’ve got the idea.</p>

<h3>How to do it with Tortoise HG 2.0</h3>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>To be able to push your branches to remote repository you have to configure TortoiseHg to allow new branches.</p>

<p>The picture:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2011/tortoisehg-branches-1.jpg" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click Synchronize</li>
<li>Click Options</li>
<li>Check “Allow push of a new branch”</li>
</ol>


<h4>Create new named branch</h4>

<p>The picture:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2011/tortoisehg-branches-2.jpg" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Select the working directory in log view</li>
<li>Click on button with name of current branch - “Branch: default”</li>
<li>Select Open a new named branch and give it a name. Short and clean. Or long but anyway clean &amp; descriptive.</li>
</ul>


<p>When you’ll press OK your current branch button will change to “New branch: feature-1”</p>

<h4>Get the work done and commit to your new branch</h4>

<p>No pictures here as working with code is a very intimate process.</p>

<p>Just be sure you’re committing to the right branch.</p>

<h4>Update to default branch</h4>

<p>Picture:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2011/tortoisehg-branches-3.jpg" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the “head” of default branch (the green label with name of the branch). Or, if you want to get creative, another branch where you want to integrate the “feature-1”.</li>
<li>Click “Update&#8230;”</li>
</ol>


<h4>Merging changes from feature-1 to default</h4>

<p>The picture:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2011/tortoisehg-branches-4.jpg" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure your working directory is default branch.</li>
<li>Click on the head of “feature-1” branch and choose “Merge with local&#8230;”</li>
</ul>


<p>A Merge dialog will open:</p>

<ul>
<li>Review one more time the what you’re about to do</li>
<li>Click Merge</li>
<li>You’ll be asked to commit your merge. Change message if you want and do commit.</li>
</ul>


<p>You’re done!</p>

<p>Well, almost&#8230; Now when you’ll push to remote repository the “feature-1” branch will be also pushed and everyone will have access to it. And your work backed up on the server.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>That’s interesting to observe how we’re getting influenced by things around us. How world we see and experience is determining <strong>what</strong> and <strong>how</strong> we do. Most of the time we’re not sensing the source of our actions and decisions. It’s very subtle. And often the “it feels right” moments are a sign that experience we’ve got, processed and incorporated is applied without realizing what exactly is done right&#8230;</p>

<p>But not this case:</p>

<p><img src="/../../../../../images/2011/metro-style-screen.png" alt="alt screenshot" /></p>

<p>I’m working on Windows Phone 7 application (yes, <a href="http://mgithub.com/">mGitHub</a> and btw it’s already available in marketplace) in my spare time and weekends and I own a WP7 device which I really like. So, there was no surprise when I’ve seen that <strong>Metro UI</strong>, the visual style of Windows Phone 7 platform, influenced me and leaked in this screen that is part of a Silverlight application.</p>

<p>Asked people what they think, got mostly positive appreciations. It would be interesting to see how this concept will evolve. It’s only an early sketch, done by a “more developer than designer”. How you like it?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today’s meeting of <a href="http://genevajug.ch/">Geneva JUG</a> was the most entertaining User Group meeting I’ve attended. Excellent speakers, great topics, mind-blowing ideas&#8230;</p>

<p>Iulian Dragos had an introductory talk about Scala. This isn’t <a href="/blog/2010/01/31/have-been-in-the-aliens-camp-twice/">my first meeting with Scala</a>, but today I’ve “got it” a bit more. Not at the level to wiling to use it and start writing apps, but I’ve understood some ideas and concepts behind it. For me it sometimes looked like C# with all the <em>language noise</em> stripped down as it has some language constructs very similar with dynamics, vars and functions in C#. And also it remembered me a bit about Boo, a strongly-typed language based on .NET runtime. Nice language with interesting features that failed to get enough traction in .NET world.</p>

<p>Oh, and then was the Jonas Bonèr, talking about Akka. What a great talk. As I’ve been diving deeper last weeks in distributed systems (and using NServiceBus to get some parts of architecture right) it was a real eye opener. Jonas was talking about three main problems in distributed world – scalability, fault-tolerance and remote interactions. Those concepts are pretty platform agnostic. But for me, living mostly in .NET word, it was very entertaining to see how things are implementing using other language on a different platform. Jonas, like a magician, where pulling from pockets akka pieces and concepts – one greater that another. And I should admit it’s something I’ve never seen in .NET. Scala’s flexibility and extensibility allows getting really complex things wrapped in a clean syntax and simple flow. Things like new async syntax in C# 5 are looking now as badly put shortcuts and “not so sweet” syntactic sugar when compared to what Scala has to offer.</p>

<p>And a big thanks to organizers of this session. Keep up rolling, guys&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A more complete solution is available in <a href="/blog/2011/06/05/integration-of-caliburn-micro-and-teleriks-silverlight-controls/">this blog post</a>. It contains code, examples and a NuGet package</p>

<p>Well, again a story about having a problem, searching for a solution and finally sharing it :)</p>

<p>So, this time it’s about trying to marry the RadTabControl from Telerik’s control set with Caliburn.Micro. I’m evaluating Telerik for our pilot project in Silverlight since I would like to speed up our development process in few areas. And then we’re using happily Caliburn.Micro in it’s Silverlight flavor.</p>

<p>Scenario: a RadTabControl should contain multiple individual TabItems composed in runtime and backed each by a View Model. And it should be completely ViewModel driven.</p>

<p>Let’s start with ViewModel, as a central piece of our code:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainPageViewModel : Conductor&lt;IScreen&gt;.Collection.OneActive
{
    private readonly FirstTabItemViewModel first;
    private readonly SecondTabItemViewModel second;

    public MainPageViewModel(FirstTabItemViewModel first, SecondTabItemViewModel second)
    {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    protected override void OnInitialize()
    {
        base.OnInitialize();
        Items.Add(first);
        Items.Add(second);

        ActivateItem(first);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>Now, we have to wrap this model in a view. In better traditions of Caliburn.Micro it’s <strong>extremely succinct and simple</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;telerik:RadTabControl x:Name="Items"&gt;
    &lt;telerik:RadTabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding DisplayName}" /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/telerik:RadTabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/telerik:RadTabControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It looks nice, but it actually doesn’t work. Yet, Caliburn.Micro is handling this way the TabControl from WPF but that of Silverlight is horribly broken (and MS isn’t in hurry to fix it). To have it work nicely with Telerik’s Silverlight RadTabControl we have to add another convention to Caliburn to hint how he should be dealing when doing bindings for RadTabControl. The code is very similar to binding conventions for WPF’s TabControl, I’ve simply adapted it to handle new case.</p>

<p>We will be adding new convention and we should do that in our override of Configure method in our Bootstrapper. The code:</p>

<pre><code>ConventionManager
    .AddElementConvention&lt;RadTabControl&gt;(RadTabControl.ItemsSourceProperty,
                                                      "ItemsSource",
                                                      "SelectionChanged")
    .ApplyBinding = (viewModelType, path, property, element, convention) =&gt;
    {
        if (!ConventionManager.SetBinding(viewModelType, path, property, element, convention))
            return false;

        var tabControl = (RadTabControl)element;
        if (tabControl.ContentTemplate == null
            &amp;&amp; tabControl.ContentTemplateSelector == null
            &amp;&amp; property.PropertyType.IsGenericType)
        {
            var itemType = property.PropertyType.GetGenericArguments().First();
            if (!itemType.IsValueType &amp;&amp; !typeof(string).IsAssignableFrom(itemType))
                tabControl.ContentTemplate = ConventionManager.DefaultItemTemplate;
        }
        ConventionManager.ConfigureSelectedItem(element,
                                                RadTabControl.SelectedItemProperty,
                                                viewModelType,
                                                path);

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(tabControl.DisplayMemberPath))
            ConventionManager.ApplyHeaderTemplate(tabControl,
                                                  RadTabControl.ItemTemplateProperty,
                                                  viewModelType);
        return true;
    };
</code></pre>

<p>And <strong>it works</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve posted complete source code with my solution on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/BlogSamples/tree/master/RadTabControlAndCaliburn">RadTabControlAndCaliburn</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 14/04/2011</strong>: Updated convention code to work with latest Caliburn.Micro 1.0 RTW.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The session was truly entertaining. David Gageot (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dgageot">@dgageot</a>) talked about Git and Mockito.</p>

<p>The talk about Git was interesting. I’m using already DVCS (Git grace to GitHub and Mercurial because of better Windows experience) but I’m very far from being an advanced Git user. Learnt few tweaks, both for Git and for presenting. It was interesting to see how David started presentation about git by showing an advanced feature, bisecting, for an auditory that was for most not familiar with DVCS and Git. Also enjoyed looking at reactions when you’re showing them how they can be more productive. I’ve seen people being very impressed, asking questions. But also seen reactions like “subversion is simpler” to “I enjoy a coffee while updating my working copy with svn&#8221;. And (a true horror story, it’s almost 2011) some people are still using CVS.</p>

<p>Then there was an intro to Mockito, a mocking framework for Java. It is very similar by idea and syntax to Rhino.Mocks and Moq from .NET world. Just, a Java penalty, mocks a little bit more verbose when compared with C#. And, surprise, no XML during whole presentation. Kidding :)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very interesting to listen to David. Really passionate about software development, productivity and best practices&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4><a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/mGitHub.SampleApp">mGitHub.SampleApp on GitHub</a></h4>

<h4><a href="http://gitstation.com">mGitHub - the real app - is available in Marketplace</a></h4>

<h4>The story</h4>

<p>I’ve been very excited when Microsoft announced a new &amp; shiny mobile platform, the Windows Phone 7. Mostly because it gave me the chance to explore new things using very familiar tools: Visual Studio 2010, C# and Silverlight. I never had enough time to start digging in this area. When I’ve read that Rob Eisenberg announced a <a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg/archive/2010/11/02/caliburn-micro-contest.aspx">Caliburn.Micro contest</a> and having lost the passion for doing my job at company I’m working now, I’ve decided to participate.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to go with an interesting idea - writing a WP7 app to work with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>. Mainly because I’m sure that I will use such app myself. GitHub is an awesome service that lets you host and collaborate on your projects freely once they are open source or if you want private projects you can have it too for a fee. I like idea and this sample application so much, the whole development process went so smooth and easy so that I’ve decided, along with participation in CM contest and publishing sources of my sample app on GitHub, to continue developing it by adding more features to offer a complete and user friendly application to work with GitHub (later about this).</p>

<h4>The app</h4>

<p><strong>mGitHub.SampleApp</strong> allows to browse few preselected projects and repositories on GitHub. You can see user/repository details, navigate trough user’s own repositories, watched repositories, view contributors and so on&#8230;</p>

<p>The use of Caliburn.Micro, which is (not only) a MVVM framework, implies that application is View Model driven. Main screen is baked by a view model, then everything else - application flow, user interactions, service calls are done within View Model classes (with few small inclusions of WP7 navigation model, view based).</p>

<p>WP7 controls like <strong>Panorama </strong>and <strong>Pivot</strong> were also used with MVVM in mind. For example, here is the code for main View Model that is serving a Panorama-based view:</p>

<pre><code>public class MainPageViewModel : Screen {
    public MainPageViewModel(MostViewedViewModel mostViewed,
                             FavoritesViewModel favorites,
                             AboutViewModel about)
    {
        MostViewed = mostViewed;
        Favorites = favorites;
        About = about;
    }

    public FavoritesViewModel Favorites { get; protected set; }
    public MostViewedViewModel MostViewed { get; protected set; }
    public AboutViewModel About { get; protected set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, here we’re just injecting our View Models for individual Panorama pages in MainPageViewModel and then <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=SimpleContainer&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">SimpleContainer</a> takes care to provide required instances. Since in a Panorama control all pages are visible (active), we’re using a simple Screen (from CM) as our base class for our VM. Then, this is how the panorama view is defined:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;controls:Panorama Title="mGitHub sample app "&gt; 
    &lt;controls:Panorama.Background&gt; 
        &lt;ImageBrush ImageSource="PanoramaBackground.jpg"/&gt; 
    &lt;/controls:Panorama.Background&gt; 
    &lt;controls:PanoramaItem x:Name="Favorites" Header="my favorites" /&gt; 
    &lt;controls:PanoramaItem x:Name="MostViewed" Header="interesting" /&gt; 
    &lt;controls:PanoramaItem x:Name="About" Header="about" /&gt; 
&lt;/controls:Panorama&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It’s nice and clean, with very good separation of concerns: each panorama page has it’s own View and a corresponding View Model. The work to glue it together is done by Caliburn.</p>

<p>The Pivot is a bit different. This control is basically a well known TabControl, it has headers and only one item is active at a time. For a PivotViewModel we’ll use a Conductor class with one active item:</p>

<pre><code>[SurviveTombstone]
public class PivotViewModel : Conductor&lt;IScreen&gt;.Collection.OneActive {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the two application Pivots, UserPivotViewModel and RepositoryPivotViewModel will just ask from container the view models of individual pages and add them to Items collection of Conductor class:</p>

<pre><code>[SurviveTombstone]
public class UserPivotViewModel : PivotViewModel {
    private readonly UserDetailsViewModel details;
    private readonly UserRepositoriesViewModel repositoriesViewModel;
    private readonly UserWatchingViewModel watchingViewModel;

    public UserPivotViewModel(UserDetailsViewModel details,
                              UserRepositoriesViewModel repositoriesViewModel,
                              UserWatchingViewModel watchingViewModel)
    {
        this.details = details;
        this.repositoriesViewModel = repositoriesViewModel;
        this.watchingViewModel = watchingViewModel;
    }
    protected override void OnInitialize()
    {
        base.OnInitialize();

        Items.Add(details);
        Items.Add(repositoriesViewModel);
        Items.Add(watchingViewModel);

        ActivateItem(details);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The view, again, is very simple, grace of Caliburn.Micro magic:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;controls:Pivot x:Name="Items" Title="{Binding PivotTitle}" SelectedItem="{Binding ActiveItem, Mode=TwoWay}"&gt; 
    &lt;controls:Pivot.HeaderTemplate&gt; 
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt; 
            &lt;TextBlock Text="{Binding DisplayName}" /&gt; 
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt; 
    &lt;/controls:Pivot.HeaderTemplate&gt; 
&lt;/controls:Pivot&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That’s why I enjoy using this framework, it makes some development tasks extremely simple.</p>

<p>Also, application make use of INavigationService,  wrapper API for Launchers/Choosers and is aware of Thombstoning. I tried to keepcode small enough to be easily followed and read, so it will not be too hard to find those places in project’s source code…</p>

<p>Another (probably interesting) piece of code in this project is communication with GitHub using their API. It’s not exactly the IGitHubHost service that I want to highlight, it’s pretty trivial. Take a look at two wrappers around RequestProcessor class, both added in order to improve User Experience when working with mGitHub.SampleApp on the phone:</p>

<ul>
<li>ProgressAwareRequestProcessor – will show a view with <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/11/smooth-loading-performanceprogressbar/">PerformanceProgressBar</a> during <strong>any</strong> remote call</li>
<li>CachingRequestProcessor – providing a extremely simplistic <strong>data cache</strong>, storing requests and their results</li>
</ul>


<p>These wrappers are registered in container and View Models even don’t know about their abilities, for them it’s just issuing a call and displaying a result. Separation of concerns is always good principle to follow&#8230;</p>

<h4>Screenshots</h4>

<p>Few screenshots, to get the sense of how UI looks like:</p>

<img src="/../../../../../images/2010/mgithub-4.png" alt="alt mgithub" /></p>

<h4>Final notes</h4>

<p>This application surely contains bugs, it probably has few strange design decisions and graphics are done by professional developer (me). But <strong>it works</strong>. It serves it’s main purpose to show how you can write an application for Windows Phone 7 using Caliburn.Micro. And I had a lot of fun working on it&#8230;</p>

<p>I’ll surely improve this sample, fix reported bugs and will listen carefully to improvement ideas. So, <strong>any</strong> <strong>feedback is welcome</strong>.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, I’m doing everything possible to release a real application to Marketplace that will be called <strong>mGitHub</strong> and will offer essentially <strong>improved experience and more features</strong>. So, if you like the idea, if you like GitHub and will most likely use the app on your phone, I would be glad to hear from you. Next time when I’ll be planning features your feedback will be considered.</p>

<p>This application weren’t tested on a real phone. I’m counting the hours until my hands will get the ordered Samsung Omnia 7 and I’ll be testing this app on real hardware. If everything goes well, expect yearly next week a feedback (and probably fixes &amp; improvements) after using the app on WP7 device.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m watching a recording of Windows Phone Design Days, it’s the part about “perceived performance” with Jaime Rodriguez. He put up a nice table with response times and recommended visual feedback. I’ve seen these recommendations before. I’ve talked about these recommendations with my team. I’m insisting applying them every time when I see in out apps that an action has no visual response within one second after triggering it.</p>

<p>Even if it’s talking in context of User Experience on Windows Phone, I think these numbers are a formal guidance for good user experience on every device, modern gadget or software application.</p>

<p>I’ll make a copy of this table here, just to keep it in a handy place for further reference. It’s so well worth keeping it&#8230;</p>
