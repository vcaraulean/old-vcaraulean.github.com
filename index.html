		<p>This post will give an overview of how you can use async/await features from C# 5.0 with <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/">Caliburn.Micro (CM)</a>. If you&#8217;ve found an error or want to complete the content please let me know in the comments. A sample application demonstrating async/await interactions in CM <a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/CaliburnMicro.AsyncDemo">is available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting it up</h2>

<p>To use Tasks and async/await features you need the latest version of Caliburn.Micro. Support for Tasks was introduced in version 1.5, so you&#8217;ll need a version higher than that. And, of course, you need .NET Framework 4.5 or higher. All examples in this post were tested in a WPF application targeting .NET 4.5 framework. However, same code will be probably valid for Silverlight, WP8 and Windows8 apps.</p>

<p>For some time already I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on rising popularity of NoSQL. From reading articles and blog posts about various aspects and flavors, I adventured myself and dived more deeply into RavenDb, a NoSQL Document Database. Still, the picture I had in my mind was somewhat blurry and had few areas where I wasn&#8217;t sure that I understand some basic things.</p>

<p>Dealing with Relational Databases, SQL and Object-Relational Mapping are probably the most omnipresent skills in any developer&#8217;s career.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I really like the new Visual Studio 2012. And the dark theme looks cool and is so much easier for the eyes.</p>

<p>But there is a real problem when you’re working with User Controls in designer. And we have lots of them. What is the problem then? Look at the picture:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="../../../../../images/2012/vs-dark-1.png"></p>

<p>Yup, that is a UserControl with few elements on it. With a default transparent background it’s is hardly visible on design surface. In runtime, when put on a parent (usually a Window) it will take background of the parent and all elements will be visible.</p>

<p>Looking trough the VS2012 settings I’ve seen options to customize Windows Form Designer, Workflow and HTML Designers but nothing about customizing the XAML designer. Pretty bad, Microsoft.</p>

<p>In this case Styling comes to the rescue! With some styling and by using a trigger to enable the style only for Design Time, we’ll get this:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="../../../../../images/2012/vs-dark-2.png"></p>

<p>Much better now! To achieve it you have to put a small XAML fragment in your Generic.xaml or App.xaml and you should be done:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;Style TargetType="{x:Type UserControl}"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;Trigger Property="ComponentModel:DesignerProperties.IsInDesignMode"
</span><span class='line'>                 Value="true"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>            &lt;Setter Property="Background"
</span><span class='line'>                    Value="White" /&gt;
</span><span class='line'>        &lt;/Trigger&gt;
</span><span class='line'>    &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/Style&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That’s how you’ll have your views well visible (and actually, design-able) in dark theme.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve looked again if there are any options in Visual Studio 2012 to lighten a bit the dark background in designer. And found an <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/758745/wpf-designer-unusable-in-dark-theme">issue reported on Microsoft Connect</a> about this very problem. Unfortunately, this is &#8220;by design&#8221; and cannot be customized, at least yet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Yes, this is an unfortunately limitation in Visual Studio 2012 RTM. We would have loved to have the ability to change the default background color of the design surface, but could not get around to it (we have it on our backlog).</p></blockquote>


<p>And a user has even posted a workaround that is mostly the same as above&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Or for whatever keeps you entertained&#8230;</p>

<p>This evening it started when I looked how to make Windows Live Writer store drafts in my SkyDrive. As usual, started with googling it. Found a <a href="http://lehsys.blogspot.ch/2011/04/how-to-change-drafts-and-recent-posts.html">trick with a registry key</a> that should point WLW to any folder I want. Nice trick, except it was not working on my PC.</p>

<p>Why a trick that works for other people isn’t working in my machine?! This hooked me up and it ended badly. In about 2 hours I’ve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Poked around WLW’s registry settings</li>
<li>Run <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/sysinternals">procmon &amp; procexp</a> on WindowsLiveWriter.exe</li>
<li>Decompiled Windows Live Writer using <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/">dotPeek</a></li>
<li>Got a rough picture of WLW’s code structure and some knowledge of it’s initialization procedure</li>
<li>Found the code that handles custom folder and seen that it should work as the trick described</li>
<li>Learned from code that WLW can run in portable code and <a href="http://www.christophdebaene.com/blog/2011/08/20/windows-live-writer-2011-tips/">how to do it</a></li>
<li>Learned how to use Just-In-Time Debugger to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a329t4ed.aspx">launch an .exe file and attach the Visual Studio’s debugger</a> from application’s start</li>
<li>Failed to make WLW crash so I can break in debugger</li>
<li>Learned about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15d1wtaf.aspx">setting a function breakpoint</a>, and that’s useless without symbols</li>
<li>Gave up&#8230;</li>
</ul>


<p>Then I had a glass of Talisker and before giving up completely tried again the trick with registry key&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>It. Worked.</strong></p>

<p>Moral of the story – stupid, evident errors happen all the time. And, sadly, it takes time to recover. You’re lucky if you’re not under pressure, running to deadline or doing a demo. And you’re really lucky if you can learn new things on the way and keep yourself entertained :)</p>

		<p>From “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Will-Measure-Your-Life-ebook/dp/B006ID0CH4/">How will you measure your life?</a>”:</p>

<blockquote><p>The theory of motivation suggests you need to ask yourself a different set of questions than most of us are used to asking. Is this work meaningful to me? Is this job going to give me a chance to develop? Am I going to learn new things? Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement? Am I going to be given responsibility? These are the things that will truly motivate you. Once you get this right, the more measurable aspects of your job will fade in importance.</p></blockquote>

<p>After starting reading this book I find myself divided. Sometimes I’m eager to go read it in one go up to the late night. Next day I’m closing it after a chapter or just a paragraph that I want to “process”. A very strange feeling.</p>

<p>But a really great reading&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<h4>A case study on porting an application that uses <a href="http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/">Caliburn.Micro</a> and <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik’s visual components</a> from Silverlight to WPF</h4>

<p>I wrote that <a href="/blog/2012/07/18/fearing-about-silverlights-future-dont/">nobody should fear an eventual migration from Silverlight to WPF</a>. But I wanted as well to work on a “proof of concept” and try to find what difficulties may arise in a such migration and how easy is to actually do it. And, preferable, do it in a small project before taking on big targets.</p>

<p>I’ll use <a href="https://github.com/vcaraulean/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik">Caliburn.Micro.Telerik</a> as my test ground. It’s a library aimed to <a href="/blog/2011/06/05/integration-of-caliburn-micro-and-teleriks-silverlight-controls/">integrate Caliburn.Micro and Telerik’s component suite for Silverlight</a>. And as I’ve been getting requests to port conventions and few helpers to WPF I’ll use it as my playground.</p>

<p>Silverlight solution contains a Silverlight library and two Silverlight applications to test conventions and other stuff. Both applications together contains more than 10 views with corresponding view models, so it should provide a fairly relevant impression about how easy is to migrate from Silverlight to WPF.</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>

<p>Restructure solution to allow cohabitation of two different versions. In this case, I want to keep both versions, so I’ll be copying files from one project to another. Duplication, but at this moment I don’t want the overhead of keeping two target frameworks with a common codebase.</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>

<p>Creating the destination point – a .NET library or WPF application:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create new Class Library targeting .NET 4 framework or WPF Application with .NET 4 Client profile.</li>
<li>Add Caliburn.Micro using Nuget</li>
<li>If it’s a class library, add references to WPF’s assemblies: PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, System.Xaml &amp; WindowsBase</li>
<li>Add references to Telerik’s assemblies. I’ve picked ones with same names as in corresponding Silverlight project.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>Getting the application canvas and infrastructure code right. This includes Caliburn’s bootstrapper, the main view &amp; all stuff to get application running. There is one difference, the main view in WPF should be a Window, while in Silverlight it was a simple UserControl.</p>

<h3>Step 4</h3>

<p>Migrating your views &amp; view models. In the case of Caliburn.Micro.Telerik examples project I’ve had to just copy the files from Silverlight to WPF project. Then it compiled and run just fine.</p>

<h3>Step 5</h3>

<p>Cleanup.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Telerik have done a pretty good job on keeping their Silverlight and WPF components in a very similar shape and at a very high compatibility level between both platforms. I hope that it doesn’t diminishes any of advantages/facilities/features of either platform.</p>

<p>Migrating a Caliburn.Micro application from SL to WPF is a piece of cake. Despite few minor differences in infrastructure code between WPF &amp; Silverlight versions of WPF, you’re pretty much left with move files, cleanup namespaces and Run. View models are ported without any issues, however you may encounter few with the views.</p>

<p>As this was a small project, porting is very straightforward and relatively simple. In a real application with lots of stuff and moving pieces you will have some more work to do. Particularly when you have some Silverlight specific code or where you’re working around platform’s limitations. Take for example mouse events. To get a “double click” you have to write custom code. Middle click doesn’t exist in Silverlight. Printing is different, file system interactions too. Communication layer (WCF &amp; service references) will need a review. There’s are no RIA services in WPF (I may be wrong here). The list may go on further, but I’ll stop here. I hope to have much more info to share about migration process as I’ll probably will take part in moving a much larger application from Silverlight to WPF.</p>

<p>That’s all. I hope my experience will help someone else to go over the fear and burden of porting a Silverlight application to WPF.</p>

<p>PS: you can have a look at final result, get sources and compare both versions on <a href="http://github.com/vcaraulean/Caliburn.Micro.Telerik">GitHub</a>.</p>

		<p>Just accept the facts, prepare &amp; migrate to WPF when ready.</p>

<p>When you have something worrying you, the best way to tackle it is to cut it straight and act on it. That&#8217;s the way to get it out of your head. If not, you&#8217;re left on the mercy of external factors that may change the circumstances and the problem will go away.</p>

<blockquote><p>“If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.”
- Sun Tzu</p></blockquote>

<p>For some time I have a strange feeling about Silverlight. Few years ago it was &#8220;the solution&#8221; for cross-platform Rich Internet Applications. It was Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;offre du jour&#8221; for Enterprise Software development, offering ease of deployment &amp; update, run anywhere premise and offering a (part of) common development platform for Windows: XAML &amp; .NET.</p>

<h4>Times are changing</h4>

<p>The rapid rise of HTML5 &amp; CSS3 have had a huge impact on client side application development. Reach features of &#8220;next web&#8221; markup &amp; styling together with explosion of JavaScript popularity (adoption &amp; tooling) makes Web Applications an extremely viable &#8220;Rich Client&#8221; solution even for Enterprise Software. And sometimes it works nicely for mobile applications too.</p>

<p>Then there is Microsoft&#8217;s focus on Windows 8 &amp; WinRT. All bets are on the new and shiny Windows 8, Office 2013, Windows Phone 8 &amp; Surface. WinRT is &#8220;the new Silverlight&#8221;, this time without the goal to run on multiple platforms but with a lot of aspirations to support Microsoft&#8217;s moves in tablet and mobile markets.</p>

<h4>And now</h4>

<p>Looking back at my experience as a Silverlight developer, there is a sensible level of deception and frustration. Missing features, cut-off or half-backed functionality, leaking resources and a failed promise to offer a viable way to develop cross-platform applications. And the worst of all, I think we&#8217;ve lost time working around various limitations of Silverlight in order to get it working properly and comply with our requirements (somewhere between 10 to 15 %%).</p>

<p>The current version of Silverlight is 5. Microsoft is quiet about his future - current releases will be supported, but absolute no information about next versions. Instead, there are plenty of rumors that there will be no Silverlight 6. Microsoft is too busy pushing the Windows 8 and the Silverlight&#8217;s incarnation on this platform, the WinRT.</p>

<h4>What do you have to loose? Not too much&#8230;</h4>

<p>More important is what you can gain by migrating your current Silverlight application to WPF:</p>

<ul>
<li>A normal Windows application, running on all versions of Windows from XP to 8.</li>
<li>The power of WPF &amp; full .NET framework.</li>
<li>Full integration with OS: printing, scanning, file system, services.</li>
<li>Better integration with other applications. MS Office, Reporting tools, you name it.</li>
<li>Touch &amp; Multi-Touch support. You can create applications for Windows 8 that aren&#8217;t Metro, but are touch friendly.</li>
</ul>


<p>The main thing you’d probably miss is the ability to run application directly in your browser, without installing it. But if it’s an Silverlight OOB application, you probably need some features not available in his sandboxed environment and running in browser is already out of question.</p>

<h4>Would it be hard to migrate to WPF? It depends&#8230;</h4>

<p>If you have a well structured application that follows good practices, it shouldn’t be a hard task to complete. Major steps to migrate a Silverlight application to WPF will be:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Libraries &amp; frameworks</strong>. If you were careful picking those, it now should be a pretty simple task of switching assemblies. Should it be the MVVM framework (Caliburn.Micro or MVVMLight), IoC container (Castle.Windsor) or third-party visual component library (Telerik, DevExpress) - usually they have versions for Silverlight and WPF. In ideal case you will end up just swapping assemblies.</li>
<li><strong>Porting the source code</strong>. Again, depending on how you&#8217;ve approached development process it may be not so hard to do. It most cases it will be just &#8220;copy files&#8221; over. But some parts would need to be rewritten, often to simplify or throw away things. I estimate that volume of code to be reviewed/rewritten will be around 15% of overall client side code. Resharper &amp; good old Find-Replace are your friends here.</li>
<li><strong>Installer &amp; application updates</strong>. Up until now you relied on Silverlight to install &amp; update the application. This part should be redone. ClickOnce is a viable solution, it will serve well your initial requirements to install and update the application. It would take 2-3 days to build, test &amp; make available a decent solution for this problem.</li>
<li><strong>Rigorous testing after migration</strong>. May be most difficult and time consuming one if you have a large application as there is no tooling support to help with it.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;m not advocating blindly for immediate migration of every Silverlight application to WPF. If your application have reached his first release, doesn&#8217;t have a long lifespan and current users are happy - you&#8217;ll probably be fine sticking with Silverlight. But if you&#8217;re still in active development or the application is a part of company&#8217;s strategic products &amp; directions, you should very seriously consider the move.</p>
